- **Weight Parsing:** Handles weight values stored as text (e.g., "5.2" or "5.2 kg") by parsing to float for sorting
- **Automatic Position Assignment:** Positions now calculated dynamically on every leaderboard request
- **Affected Pages:**
  - Homepage live leaderboard section
  - Competition details page leaderboard tab
  - Dedicated leaderboard page
  - User profile statistics
- **Testing Note:** Leaderboard will display data once admin creates competitions and enters weigh-in data

## October 10, 2025 - React Query Caching Fix for Real-time Data Updates

[x] 110. Investigate React Query caching configuration causing stale data issues
[x] 111. Fix staleTime from Infinity to 0 to make data immediately refresh
[x] 112. Enable refetchOnMount to refresh data when navigating between pages
[x] 113. Enable refetchOnWindowFocus to refresh data when returning to browser tab
[x] 114. Restart workflow to apply React Query caching fixes
[x] 115. Update progress tracker with caching configuration fixes

## React Query Caching Fix Details:
- **Root Cause:** Extremely aggressive caching settings were preventing real-time data updates
  - `staleTime: Infinity` meant data was NEVER considered stale
  - `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` prevented refetching when returning to tab
  - `refetchOnMount: false` prevented refetching when navigating between pages
- **Solution:** Updated queryClient configuration in client/src/lib/queryClient.ts:
  - Changed `staleTime: Infinity` → `staleTime: 0` (data is immediately stale)
  - Changed `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` → `refetchOnWindowFocus: true`
  - Added `refetchOnMount: true` to refetch when components mount
- **User Impact:**
  - Data now refreshes automatically when navigating between pages
  - No more need for hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to see updates
  - Admin changes appear immediately on user-facing pages
  - Window focus triggers data refresh for latest updates
- **Performance:** While more frequent fetching, the app remains fast with server-side caching and efficient API endpoints

[x] 192. Architect review and approval of all weight conversion and end date features (✅ Pass)
[x] 193. Restart workflow and verify application running successfully

## Weight Conversion Implementation Details:
- **Smart Conversion Logic:** 
  - Detects if weight already ends with "lbs" or "lb" - returns as-is (no conversion)
  - Detects if weight ends with "kg" - strips "kg" and converts by multiplying by 2.20462
  - If no unit detected - assumes kg and converts to lbs
- **Prevents Double-Conversion:** Using regex pattern `/lbs?$/i` to check for existing lbs values
- **Locations Updated:**
  - Admin anglers participation history (competition weights)
  - Admin anglers stats (best catch)
  - Competition details leaderboard tab
- **Conversion Factor:** 2.20462 (standard kg to lbs conversion)
- **Error Handling:** Falls back to original value or "-" for NaN/invalid weights

## October 22 Enhancements Summary:

**Completed:**
- ✅ **Admin Anglers Bio Fields**: Fixed API to return all user bio fields (club, location, favouriteMethod, favouriteSpecies, bio) - removed duplicate endpoint that was limiting fields
- ✅ **Weight Display**: Completely removed kg-to-lbs conversion across entire application - weights now stored and displayed as-is (in lbs only):
  - Admin panel weigh-in
  - Homepage leaderboard
  - Leaderboard page
  - Competition details
  - Profile statistics
  - Admin anglers history
- ✅ **Password Update Backend**: Added complete password update system with validation and security
- ✅ **Profile Picture Support**: Avatar field added to schema and update logic - upload endpoint already configured

**In Progress:**
- ⏳ **UK Timezone**: Competition times currently stored as UTC - proper UK timezone handling requires date-fns-tz library
- ⏳ **Profile Picture UI**: Backend ready, needs frontend upload component
- ⏳ **Password Settings UI**: Backend ready, needs frontend settings dialog

**Note**: Weights are now stored and displayed exactly as entered by admin (in lbs). No automatic conversion occurs anywhere in the system.

**Dark Mode Enforcement:**
- ThemeProvider now hard-coded to "dark" theme only
- Removed all theme switching UI elements from admin panel
- Application permanently displays in dark mode with no toggle option
- Verified via screenshot - admin login page displays in dark mode

**Local File Upload System:**
- Installed multer package for handling multipart/form-data
- Created `/api/upload` endpoint with file validation (images only, 5MB limit)
- Static file serving configured at `/assets/uploads/` for all uploaded images
- Files organized by category in subdirectories (slider, news, gallery, sponsors, logo)

**Admin Panel File Upload Forms:**

## October 16, 2025 - Image Upload Path Fix

[x] 212. User reported image upload issue - files saved but paths not in database
[x] 213. Enabled MongoDB Atlas connection with MONGODB_URI secret
[x] 214. Identified root cause - multer destination callback couldn't access req.body.type for multipart/form-data
[x] 215. Fixed upload endpoint to use temp directory then move files to correct type-specific folders
[x] 216. Tested all upload types: slider, logo, news, gallery, sponsors - all working correctly
[x] 217. Verified uploaded images are accessible via /assets/uploads/{type}/{filename}
[x] 218. Confirmed file organization: each type has its own subdirectory in attached_assets/uploads/
[x] 219. Update progress tracker with image upload path fix

## Image Upload Path Fix Details:

**Problem Identified:**
- Files were being uploaded but saved to wrong directories (defaulting to 'gallery')
- The `req.body.type` field wasn't available in multer's destination callback for multipart/form-data
- Image paths couldn't be properly constructed because files weren't in expected directories

**Solution Implemented:**
- Changed multer configuration to upload to temporary directory first
- After upload completes, read `req.body.type` from parsed form data
- Move file from temp to correct type-specific directory using fs.renameSync()
- Return correct file path: `/assets/uploads/{type}/{filename}`

**Files Affected:**
- server/routes.ts - Modified upload endpoint configuration

**Verification:**
- ✅ Slider images: /assets/uploads/slider/
- ✅ Logo images: /assets/uploads/logo/
- ✅ News images: /assets/uploads/news/
- ✅ Gallery images: /assets/uploads/gallery/
- ✅ Sponsor logos: /assets/uploads/sponsors/

**Security Maintained:**
- Whitelist validation still enforced
- Path traversal prevention still active
- File type validation unchanged
- Size limits still enforced (5MB max)

✅ **Image Upload Path Issue Resolved**
✅ **All Upload Types Working Correctly**
✅ **Files Organized by Type in Correct Directories**
✅ **MongoDB Atlas Connected for Data Persistence**
