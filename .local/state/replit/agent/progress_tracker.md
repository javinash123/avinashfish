## October 10, 2025 - React Query Caching Fix for Real-time Data Updates

[x] 110. Investigate React Query caching configuration causing stale data issues
[x] 111. Fix staleTime from Infinity to 0 to make data immediately refresh
[x] 112. Enable refetchOnMount to refresh data when navigating between pages
[x] 113. Enable refetchOnWindowFocus to refresh data when returning to browser tab
[x] 114. Restart workflow to apply React Query caching fixes
[x] 115. Update progress tracker with caching configuration fixes

## React Query Caching Fix Details:
- **Root Cause:** Extremely aggressive caching settings were preventing real-time data updates
  - `staleTime: Infinity` meant data was NEVER considered stale
  - `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` prevented refetching when returning to tab
  - `refetchOnMount: false` prevented refetching when navigating between pages
- **Solution:** Updated queryClient configuration in client/src/lib/queryClient.ts:
  - Changed `staleTime: Infinity` → `staleTime: 0` (data is immediately stale)
  - Changed `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` → `refetchOnWindowFocus: true`
  - Added `refetchOnMount: true` to refetch when components mount
- **User Impact:**
  - Data now refreshes automatically when navigating between pages
  - No more need for hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to see updates
  - Admin changes appear immediately on user-facing pages
  - Window focus triggers data refresh for latest updates
- **Performance:** While more frequent fetching, the app remains fast with server-side caching and efficient API endpoints
