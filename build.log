transforming...
Browserslist: browsers data (caniuse-lite) is 14 months old. Please run:
  npx update-browserslist-db@latest
  Why you should do it regularly: https://github.com/browserslist/update-db#readme

A PostCSS plugin did not pass the `from` option to `postcss.parse`. This may cause imported assets to be incorrectly transformed. If you've recently added a PostCSS plugin that raised this warning, please contact the package author to fix the issue.

rendering chunks...
computing gzip size...
../dist/public/index.html                     1.11 kB │ gzip:   0.60 kB
../dist/public/assets/index-BWNKeJs8.css    130.84 kB │ gzip:  19.88 kB
../dist/public/assets/index-BohnfBiv.js   1,167.33 kB │ gzip: 304.35 kB

(!) Some chunks are larger than 1000 kB after minification. Consider:
- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
